Soccer Action is a Drag & Drop editor of soccer actions and tactics for your WordPress website.

== Description ==
Soccer Action is a Drag & Drop editor of soccer actions and tactics for your WordPress website.

With this plugin, you can finally talk about soccer and, at the same time, visually represent the actions on your posts.

## Upgrade to Soccer Engine

For more functionalities, consider purchasing the [Soccer Engine WordPress plugin](https://daext.com/soccer-engine/). An epic project for soccer-related websites that include 33 dedicated Gutenberg blocks, 40 menus to manage your soccer data, REST API to read and write the plugin data from external applications, and other unique features.

## Create a soccer action

The drag and drop editor of soccer actions is available in a dedicated WordPress menu named **Actions**.

To create a soccer action, follow this procedure:

1. Assign a name to the action with the **Description** field
2. Select the category of graphical assets with the **Assets** select box
3. Click on a specific graphical asset included in the **Elements** section to add it to the field
4. Drag and drop the new element in a custom position
5. Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 to include other elements in the field
6. Save the soccer action by clicking on the **Save Changes** button

Note that you can at any time remove an element from the field with a double click on the element.

## Add an action in a post

You can include soccer actions in your posts, pages, or custom post types with this procedure:

1. Visit the **Actions** menu and copy the shortcode associated with the action
2. Create a **Shortcode** block and paste the shortcode available in the clipboard

## Responsive

The soccer actions generated by this plugin are automatically resized based on the dimension of the container. For this reason, the browser will always display your actions correctly both on desktop and mobile devices.

## Credits
